INTRODUCTION                                             *Neo-tree-Introduction*

Neo-tree is a plugin for nvim that can display tree structures in a sidebar.
The current version supports one source, which is a filesystem browser. Future
versions will add suport for other sources.


COMMANDS                                                     *Neo-tree-Commands*

Neo-tree does not define any default keybindings for nvim. The suggested
keybinding is:

    nnoremap / :NeoTreeFocus<cr>                          

|NeoTreeFocus|                                                    *NeoTreeFocus*
NeoTreeFocus will open the sidebar and focus it if it is closed, and just switch
to the neo-tree window if it is already open. 

|NeoTreeShow|                                                      *NeoTreeShow*
You can also use NeoTreeShow which will open the tree, but leave the current
window focused.

|NeoTreeReveal|                                                  *NeoTreeReveal*
NeoTreeReveal is like NeoTreeFocus, but it will also find whatever file is in
the current buffer, expand all nodes needed to reveal it, and set the cursor on
that file. If the current file is not in the current working directory, you will
be prompted to change it.

|NeoTreeClose|                                                    *NeoTreeClose*
Close the Neo-tree window.

MAPPINGS                                                                      ~

                                                            *Neo-tree-Mappings*

NAVIGATION                                                *Neo-tree-Navigation*

Within the neo-tree window, the following mappings are defined by default.
Note: The "selected" item is the line the cursor is currently on.

<2-LeftMouse> = open:        Expand or collapse a folder. If a file is selected,
                             open it in the window closest to the tree.
<cr>          = open:        Same as above.
S             = open_split:  Same as open, but opens in a new horizontal split.
s             = open_vsplit: Same as open, but opens in a vertical split
<bs>          = navigate_up: Moves the root directory up one level.
.             = set_root:    Changes the root directory to the currently 
                             selected folder.


FILE ACTIONS                                            *Neo-tree-File-Actions*
a    = add:                  Create a new file or directory.
d    = delete:               Delete the selected file or directory.
r    = rename:               Rename the selected file or directory.
c    = copy_to_clipboard:    Mark file to be copied.
x    = cut_to_clipboard:     Mark file to be cut (moved).
p    = paste_from_clipboard: Copy/move each marked file in the to the
                             selected folder.


VIEW CHANGES                                            *Neo-tree-View-Changes*
H = toggle_hidden:    Toggle whether hidden files (.*) are shown or not.
I = toggle_gitignore: Toggle whether the gitignore file is
                      respected.
R = refresh:          Rescan the filesystem and redraw the tree. Changes
                      made within nvim should be detected automatically, but
                      this is useful for changes made elsewhere.


FILTER                                                        *Neo-tree-Filter*
/     = filter_as_you_type: Filter the tree recursively, searching for
                            files and folders that contain the specified term as
                            you type. This will fd if it is installed, or find.
f     = filter_on_submit:   Same as above, but does not search until you hit
                            enter. Useful if filter_as_you_type is too slow.
<C-x> = clear_filter:       Removes the filter.

CONFIGURATION                                                                  ~

SETUP                                                           *Neo-tree-Setup*

To override the defaults or add new functionality, call the setup() function
with your overrides. For example, to add your own mappings in 'lua':
>
require("neo-tree").setup({
  filesystem = {
    window = {
      mappings = {
        ["<F5>"] = "refresh",
        ["o"] = "open",
      }
    }
  }
})

Below is a complete skeleton of all of the configuration options, ready for
copy and paste into your lua config file.

The following highlight groups are defined by this plugin. If you set any of
these yourself before the plugin loads, it will not be touched. If they do not
exist, they will be created.

NeoTreeCursorLine     |hi-CursorLine| override in Neo-tree window.
NeoTreeDirectoryName  Directory name.
NeoTreeDirectoryIcon  Directory icon.
NeoTreeFileIcon       File icon, when not overriden by devicons.
NeoTreeFileName       File name, when not overwritten by another status.
NeoTreeFileNameOpened File name when the file is open. Not used yet.
NeoTreeFilterTerm     The filter term, as displayed in the root node.
NeoTreeFloatBorder    The border for pop-up windows.
NeoTreeGitAdded       File name when the git status is added.
NeoTreeGitConflict    File name when the git status is conflict.
NeoTreeGitModified    File name when the git status is modified.
NeoTreeGitUntracked   File name when the git status is untracked.
NeoTreeNormal         |hl-Normal| override in Neo-tree window.
NeoTreeNormalNC       |hi-NormalNC| override in Neo-tree window.
NeoTreeRootName       The name of the root node.
NeoTreeTitleBar       Used for the title bar of pop-ups, when the border-style
                      is set to "NC". This is derived from NeoTreeFloatBorder.
